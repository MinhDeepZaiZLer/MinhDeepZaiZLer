## 🚀 About Me

I’m a developer from Da Nang, Vietnam, passionate about building systems that connect software with real-world hardware. I enjoy working across embedded systems, robotics, and mobile application development. I love solving problems, experimenting with control systems, and creating real products that are fun and useful.

### Interests & Focus Areas:

* **Robotics & Embedded Systems**: ESP32, Arduino, 8051, FreeRTOS, PID control, fuzzy logic tuning, motor drivers & sensor integration.
* **Mobile Development**: Android Kotlin (Jetpack Compose + Mapbox), Flutter (multi-platform UI & state management).
* **Full-stack Mobile Systems**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Storage), REST APIs, clean architecture patterns.
* **Applied AI & Recommendation Systems**: Content-based & collaborative filtering, dataset analysis.

## 📚 Highlighted Projects

* **WeRun / WeRun 2.0**
  A running-tracker fitness application.

  * **WeRun** → Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Firebase
  * **WeRun 2.0** → Upgraded & rebuilt with **Flutter** with improved UI, achievements, goals tracking, sharing & friend leaderboard.

* **FoodHere Delivery App (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + SePay + Firebase)**
  A colorful and modern food delivery app with features such as:

  * Restaurant & dish browsing
  * Wishlists & ratings
  * Cart + order tracking
  * Online payment (VNPay / SePay / MoMo integration)
  * Real-time driver tracking with Mapbox
    Designed with a friendly visual style for young audiences.

* **Autonomous Stair-Climbing Line-Follower Robot**
  A robot capable of detecting stairs, climbing, maintaining balance, and re-acquiring the line using:

  * ESP32 + FreeRTOS task scheduling
  * PID tuning on 5-sensor line array
  * Height sensing with ultrasonic HC-SR04
  * Automatic mode switching based on environment detection.

* **6-Wheel Autonomous Navigation Vehicle (ESP32)**
  Uses TCRT5000 line sensors + dual motor driver (L298N) with logic routines for route following and obstacle avoidance.

* **Restaurant Recommendation System**
  Combines collaborative filtering & content-based filtering on the ChefMoz & GeoPlaces datasets to suggest restaurants personalized for user tastes.
